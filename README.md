This is a repository to construct ChiMed corpus. 

## Copyright Issue

We have came to an agreement with the [39ask](http://ask.39.net/) company (who has the copyright of the data) to release the data. Therefore, we will **NOT** provide the crawler to crawl the data. The new data is much larger than the one we used in the paper, where we are planing to release around 200k QA pairs. Note that according to our contract with 39ask, the new 200k data may have no overlap with the data we used in the paper, so that we recommend you to use the new data for any non-frofit research porpose.

We are working on the data release now and it will be available in early 2020. If you are interested in the dataset and want to get any updates from us, please send an e-mail to ```yhtian@uw.edu``` and we will let you know when the data is ready for downloading.
